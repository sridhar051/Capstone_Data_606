# PlantGuard: AI Disease Detection & Real-Time Plant Advice  

**PlantGuard** is a smart system designed to identify plant diseases and provide real-time assistance to users. By combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for disease detection and **Large Language Models (LLM)** for personalized advice, PlantGuard empowers gardeners, farmers, and plant enthusiasts with actionable insights to maintain plant health effectively.  

## Features  
- **Accurate Disease Detection**: Uses CNNs to identify plant diseases from leaf images with high accuracy (96.43%).  
- **Personalized Advice**: Provides tailored recommendations through an LLM-powered chatbot, helping users manage plant health and care effectively.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to upload images and receive results instantly.  
- **Real-Time Chatbot Support**: Answers queries about plant diseases, treatment options, and general care tips in simple language.  
- **Sustainability Focus**: Promotes sustainable practices by reducing reliance on harmful pesticides and enabling early disease detection.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: For image analysis and disease detection.  
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: Powered by OpenAI's API to provide interactive and intelligent responses.  
- **Web-Based Interface**: Built to ensure ease of use and accessibility.  
- **Python**: Core programming language for model development and integration.  
- **Flask/Streamlit**: Frameworks for developing the web interface (based on implementation).  

## System Workflow  
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image of the plant's leaf via the web interface.  
2. **Disease Detection**: The system processes the image using the CNN model and identifies the disease.  
3. **Result Display**: The system displays the diagnosis and recommendations on the web interface.  
4. **Chatbot Assistance**: Users can interact with the chatbot for further advice and general tips on plant care.  

## Results  
The CNN model achieved an accuracy of **96.43%** after retraining, ensuring reliable detection of various plant diseases.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Support for additional plant species and diseases.  
- Multilingual support for chatbot responses.  
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time monitoring.
